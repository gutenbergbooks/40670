<p class="caption2">PREFACE</p>


<p>When it is remembered what a
prominent part Agriculture plays
in the history of all Nations, it does
seem strange that so little is known of
the lives of those pioneers who have
been foremost in the discovery of fundamental
principles, improved methods, and
labour-saving machines. Perhaps it is
that farmers as a whole are not specially
fond of reading. This, however, is not to
be wondered at, because after a long day's
work in the open air it is hard to rivet
one's mind on anything more serious than
the headlines of a daily newspaper, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
rose-tinted pictures of a rural magazine.
Still, it is safe to prophesy that the
successful farmer of the future will not
only be a hard worker, but also a hard
reader. And biography brings before us,
in a vivid manner, the onward march of
modern Agriculture.</p>

<p>It is also of interest to note how much
Agriculture owes to men who could
scarcely be called practical farmers.
Indeed, the author has been impressed,
contrary to common opinion, with the
success of the Townsman who takes to
farming. But this is really no more
surprising than that the simple-hearted
farm lad should forsake the Old Homestead
for the fascinations of the City, and
by reason of his character, courage, and
industry, become in a few years the
Captain of some great commercial enterprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
There will always be the ceaseless
ebb and flow of the human tide between
country lane and crowded street. But it
is surely our plain duty to do something
to make the life of the worker in the field
less dull and lonely, and more attractive
by the erection of pleasant cottages and
the establishment of rural industries:
while, at the same time, we try to
brighten the life of the toiler in the
town by freehold garden lots and sunlit,
open spaces.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Eight miles to the north-west of
Reading, on a lovely reach of the
River Thames, lies the parish town of
Basildon, in the County of Berkshire.
Here, in the year 1674, was born the
man who revolutionized British agriculture
and laid the foundations for the
"Conquest of the Desert." Yet, strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
as it may seem, until the other day Tull's
grave was unknown, and even now no
monument marks the resting-place of this
illustrious husbandman. His family was
of ancient and honourable lineage, and
he was heir to a competent estate. At
seventeen he entered his name on the
register of St. John's College, Oxford;
but he did not proceed to a degree. Two
years later he was admitted as a student
of Gray's Inn, and was, in due course,
called to the Bar. It is probable that
Tull studied law not so much with the
thought of taking it up seriously as a
profession, but simply in order to better
fit himself for a political career. Ill-health,
however, made him turn his
attention to farming. At the age of
twenty-five he married a lady of good
family, Miss Susanna Smith, of the
County of Warwick, and then settled
down to farm in Oxfordshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>His first farm was Howberry, in the
parish of Crowmarsh. The land of this
farm was fertile and renowned for heavy
crops of both wheat and barley. Here
Tull lived and toiled for nine years, till
at last his health broke down and he
was ordered south to the milder climate
of France and Italy. So he decided to
sell a portion of his Oxfordshire estate
and send his family to another farm in
Berkshire named "Prosperous," situated
in the parish of Shalbourne. After an
absence of three years Tull returned to
"Prosperous Farm"&mdash;a place for ever
famous in the annals of agriculture. Here
he lived for twenty-six years to the close
of his strenuous, chequered career. Of
this farm, Tull writes: "Situated on a
little chalk on one side and heath on the
other, the soil is poor and shallow&mdash;generally
too light and too shallow to
produce a tolerable crop of beans. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
farm was made out of the skirts of
others; a great part was a sheep down
with a full reputation of poverty."</p>

<p>While in Europe Tull took special
note of the deep and careful cultivation
of the vineyards, where the tillage of the
soil between the rows of the grape vines
was made to take the place of manuring
the land. On his return to England he
tried this method at "Prosperous Farm,"
first with turnips and potatoes, and then
with wheat. And by adopting this simple
system with some few modifications of
his own, he was enabled to grow wheat
on the same fields for thirteen years continuously
without the use of manure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on his farm of Howberry that
Tull invented and perfected his drill in
the year 1701. He has told the story of
this invention in the pages of his great
work. Finding his plans for growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sainfoin<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> hindered by the distaste of his
labourers for his new methods, he resolved
to try to "contrive an engine to plant
St. Foin more faithfully than such hands
would do. For that purpose I examined
and compared all the mechanical ideas
that ever had entered my imagination,
and at last pitched upon a groove, tongue,
and spring in the sound-board of the
organ. With these, a little altered, and
some parts of two other instruments, as
foreign to the field as the organ is, added
to them, I composed my machine. It
was named a drill, because, when farmers
used to sow their beans and peas in
channels or furrows by hand, they called
that action drilling." And thus Tull's
drill, taken from the rotary mechanism of
his favourite organ, is the pioneer of all
modern planters. His first invention was
what he termed a <i>drill-plough</i> to sow
wheat and turnip seed three rows at a
time.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
A leguminous plant cultivated for fodder.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this invention that led Tull
to enunciate his first principle of tillage,
namely, <i>drilling</i>. And it is the more
amazing to reflect that even after this
long lapse of time many farmers still
persist in broadcasting their seed; for, as
a recent authority working on the semi-arid
lands of Montana writes: "Sowing
broadcast is bad at any time, but in dry-farming
it is suicidal." That the use of
the drill has everywhere effected an enormous
saving of seed is common knowledge;
but let us hear what Tull has to
say under this head: "Seed (sainfoin)
was scarce, dear, and bad, and enough
could scarce be got to sow, as was usual,
seven bushels<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to an acre. I examined
and thought the matter out, and found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the greater part of the seed miscarried,
being bad, or too much covered. I observed,
and counted, and found when
much seed had miscarried the crop was
best." Here was his second principle,
<i>reduction of seed</i>, or, as we now say,
"thin-seeding," a practice which has been
adopted by the dry-farmers of Utah with
remarkable success.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
At the present time it is customary to sow from
80-100 lb. of sainfoin seed per acre.</p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, Tull was an ardent advocate
of the weedless field, and he saw, clearly
enough, that dung was a serious menace
to clean tillage, as the seeds of troublesome
weeds were apt to be scattered far
and wide over the farm. This led him
to lay down as his third principle&mdash;the
<i>absence of weed</i>. But he certainly never,
as is sometimes said, condemned the use
of manure. His experiments, however,
proved beyond the shadow of doubt that
good crops might be grown simply and
solely by means of deep and constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
tillage. So he says, angrily: "The vulgar
in general believe that I carried my farmyard
dung and threw it in a river. I
have no river near; besides, my neighbours
buy dung at a good price; but it is
known I neither sell nor waste any dung.
Against such lying tongues there is no
defence."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many years after his part
was taken by none other than the great
scientist of Rothamsted, the late Sir John
Lawes, who wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tull was quite an original genius and
a century in advance of his time. I consider
he has been most unjustly accused of
not placing sufficient value upon farmyard
manure; he advocated cleanliness, and
saw that dung was a great carrier of
weeds. To give some clear idea of the
value of Tull's advocacy of drill-husbandry
and the freedom from weed which can
alone be obtained by the use of the drill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
I may mention that so far as statistics will
allow, I have ascertained the average yield
of the wheat crop of the world, and I am
able to say that the average yield is less
than it is at the present time upon my
permanent wheat land, after more than
sixty years absolutely without manure.
Here we have the result of Tull's three
great principles&mdash;<i>drilling, reduction of
seed, and absence of weed</i>. If he were alive
now and were writing for the agriculture
of the world, he would, I think, be quite
justified in saying everything he said in
regard to cleanliness and manure."</p>

<p>As a result of his studies, travels, and
experiments, Tull published "The New
Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: or an Essay
on the Principles of Tillage and Vegetation"
in the year 1731. The great value
of this work is that it is founded not upon
mere theory, but upon actual experiments
in the field. The fourth edition, which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
have beside me, consists of 426 pages, with
several plates, and 23 chapters which treat
of the following subjects: Of Roots and
Leaves; Of Food of Plants; Of Pastures
of Plants; Of Dung; Of Tillage; Of
Weeds; Of Turnips; Of Wheat; Of
Smuttiness; Of Lucerne; Of Change of
Species; Of Change of Individuals; Of
Ridges; Old and New Husbandry; Of
Ploughs; The Four-Coulter'd Plough;
Of the Drill-Boxes; Of the Wheat-Drill:
Of the Turnip-Drill; Of the Hoe-Plough;
with an appendix concerning the making
of the drill and the hoe-plough.</p>

<p>Tull's idea&mdash;which was that by tillage
soils might be constantly and for ever
reinvigorated or renewed&mdash;is summed up
in his famous epigram, "tillage is manure."
He believed that the earth was the true
and the sole food of the plant, and, further,
that the plant feeds and grows by taking
in minute particles of soil. And since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
these particles are thrown off from the
surface of the soil grains, it followed,
therefore, that the more finely the soil
was divided the more numerous the particles
and the more readily the plant would
grow. Although Tull's theories were
wrong, his practice has been followed by
all progressive farmers down to the present
time. We now know that plants do not absorb
particles of earth, but take in food in
solution. Consequently, the more the
particles of soil are broken up and refined,
the more plant food the roots can absorb.
In this volume, which must be counted
an agricultural classic, Tull at once takes
rank as the foremost preacher of his time
of the gospel of deep and perfect tillage.
And it is a work which, in the words of
his great compeer, Arthur Young, will
"unquestionably carry his name to the
latest posterity."</p>

<p>The botanical world has recently been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
illumined by the splendid discovery of the
principles of heredity set forth by Gregor
Mendel, and the foremost exponent of
the new science, Professor Bateson, writes
as follows: "We have at last a brilliant
method and a solid basis from which to
attack these problems, offering an opportunity
to the pioneer such as occurs but
seldom even in the history of modern
science." Cannot we, as agriculturists,
say the same with equal truth? For, to
our thinking, Jethro Tull bears the same
relation to dry-farming that Mendel does
to plant-breeding. For if, on the one
hand, his drill-ploughs are the models
from which have been derived the marvellous
agricultural machines of modern
times, then, on the other, his clean husbandry,
his seed selection, his deep and
constant tillage are the fundamental
principles in the great new science of
dry-farming. Nor should we forget that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
both Mendel and Tull enunciated their
principles only after long and patient
experiment.</p>

<p>The principles which we have adopted
in our experiments on the Government
Dry-Land Station at Lichtenburg, in the
Transvaal and which we propose to
follow on all stations hereafter to be
established in the Union of South Africa,
are seven in number, namely: (1) Deep
ploughing; (2) drilling; (3) thin seeding;
(4) frequent harrowing; (5) weedless
lands; (6) few varieties; and (7) moisture-saving
fallows. And we know full well
that the more faithfully we adhere to
this scheme the richer shall be our
harvests. But, after all, these principles
are merely the amplification, nothing
more, of those fundamental methods of
tillage so plainly set forth, one hundred
and eighty-two years ago, by the genius
of Jethro Tull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Tull died in the month of March, in
the year 1740, at the age of sixty-six.
In speaking of agricultural education we
have frequently urged the benefits to be
derived from a liberal education, and we
like to recall Tull's own words: "I owe
my principles and practice originally to my
travels, as I owe my drill to my organ."
Here indeed, was a man of many parts&mdash;a
famous agriculturist, an able mechanic,
a good musician, and a keen classical
scholar. His life, strange to say, was one
dauntless struggle with disease. For six
years he scarce ever left his room, and
seldom in that period was he gladdened
by so much as a glimpse of his "hundred
acres of drilled wheat." So they laid the
tired body of the simple-minded English
squire under the yew-trees of Basildon in
the mellow soil he loved so well. But
the bells of the old church of Saint
Bartholomew now ring out with a new,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
glad message, for they tell the toiling
husbandmen of all lands to be of good
cheer, for the desert shall rejoice and
blossom as the rose; while the winds and
the waters carry the echo of Tull's name
down through the corridors of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall
stand before Kings; he shall not stand before mean men."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of this article we
have quoted a text taken from the
Proverbs of Solomon, which we believe
can be applied more truthfully to the
subject of our paper than to any other
name conspicuous in the annuals of agriculture.
For he was a man diligent in
his business and he stood before Kings.</p>

<p>Thomas William Coke, of Holkham
(Holy Home), Earl of Leicester, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
eldest son of Robert Wenman. He was
born in the year 1752, and educated at
Eton, after which he travelled abroad.
On the death of his father, Coke was
elected in his place as member of Parliament
for the County of Norfolk. He was
then in his twenty-second year. He
entered the youngest member; his
political career extended over a period
of fifty-seven years, and he finished up
as "Father of the House of Commons."
His domestic life was singularly happy&mdash;very
different from the sad state of his
great contemporary Arthur Young. In
1775 he married his cousin, Jane Dutton,
by whom he had three daughters. After
her death in 1800 he remained a widower
for twenty-one years and then at the age
of sixty-eight wedded a girl of eighteen,
Lady Anne Keppel, by whom he had
five sons and one daughter. Coke had
the unique experience of being offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a Peerage seven times under six different
Prime Ministers, and he was the first
commoner raised to the Peerage by
Queen Victoria on her accession to the
Throne. In this connection an amusing
story is told. In the year 1817 Coke
was called on to present, at a Levee, a
very forcible address to the Prince of
Wales, who was then acting as Regent,
praying him "to dismiss from his presence
and Council those advisers, who, by their
conduct, had proved themselves alike
enemies to the Throne and the people."
The Regent was warned of the proposal.
Knowing that Coke valued his position
as a Commoner above everything else,
he declared with an oath that: "If Coke
of Norfolk enters my presence, by God,
I'll knight him." This speech was repeated
to Coke. "If he dares," was the
rejoinder, "by God I'll break his sword."</p>

<p>Part of the estate or Holkham was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
formerly a series of salt marshes on the
coast of the North Sea. And when Coke
came into his property in 1776&mdash;a fateful
year in the history of the British Empire
the surrounding district was little better
than a rabbit-warren, with long stretches
of shingle and sand. Soon after Coke's
marriage, when his wife remarked that she
was going down to Norfolk, the witty old
Lady Townshend said, "Then, my dear,
all you will see will be one blade of grass
and two rabbits fighting for that." The
story of how Coke came to be a practical
farmer is told in the third volume of the
Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society
of England, published in the year 1842.
The article containing it was written by
Earl Spencer, and is of special interest as
he had it direct from the lips of Mr. Coke
(then Lord Leicester) a short time before
his death. When Coke entered into his
heritage, he found that five leases were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
about to expire. These farms were held
at a rental of 3s. 6d. an acre; and in the
previous leases they had been valued at
1s. 6d. an acre. At that time the agriculture
of Norfolk was of the poorest
character; and we may judge of the
quality of the Holkham land by comparing
it with the average rent of 10s. an acre
which Arthur Young says prevailed at
this time. Coke sent for the two tenants,
Mr. Brett and Mr. Tann, and offered to
renew their leases at a slightly higher
figure, namely 5s. an acre. Both refused;
and Mr. Brett jeered at the suggestion,
saying that the land was not worth even
the 1s. 6d. an acre which had originally
been paid for it. This curt refusal was
enough for a man of Coke's temperament.
He forthwith decided to farm the land
himself. It was thus that a young man
of twenty-two, possessor of a princely
fortune, fresh from the salons of Europe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
suddenly turned his back on a gay and
fashionable world; and stung into action
by the laughter of a lazy tenant, took up
the management of a sterile farm, raised
a parish from poverty to affluence, transformed
a desolate county into a cornfield,
and left a name renowned in the annals of
English agriculture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the history of agriculture, the name
of Coke is chiefly remembered by those
famous gatherings locally known as
"Coke's Clippings." These wonderful
meetings began in a simple way with the
clipping or shearing of sheep, but soon
came to embrace the whole realm of the
rural industry. As might be imagined,
when Coke took over the management of
his farms, he had not the slightest knowledge
of the science and practice of
agriculture. So he called together his
neighbours and frankly asked their advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>They in turn were doubtless glad to meet
a young man so keen and so eager to
learn. Soon they brought their friends
and their relatives, and two years later
these little country gatherings had assumed
a more definite character, and were thereupon
called "Coke's Clippings." Soon
agriculturists from all parts of Great
Britain wrote to ask if they might attend.
Swiftly and steadily the fame of the
"clippings" grew, till presently scientific
and other celebrated men from the United
States and the Continent travelled to
England to take part in these meetings.
Year by year they increased in numbers
till at last they embraced every nationality,
every profession, and every rank in life,
from Royalty to the poorest peasant.
Holkham had, in fact, become a great
experimental farm&mdash;a private estate turned
by the enterprise of its owner into a public
institution. Nowadays, we are familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
with State experimental farms, which are
visited by thousands of farmers once or
twice a year. But a century ago such a
thing was unheard of, and Coke may
justly be termed the "Father of the
Experimental Farm." At these shearings
Coke presented many cups and prizes for
the invention of any new agricultural
implement, for suggestions with regard to
improved systems of cropping, of irrigation,
of enriching the soil, and for articles
on agricultural subjects&mdash;in a word, to
every one who contributed to advance
any branch whatsoever of the agricultural
industry. Moreover, we are told that at
a meeting of 1803 sweepstakes were offered
for guessing the correct weight of a wether.
The winner was a certain Mr. Money Hill,
who guessed the exact weight&mdash;130 lbs.;
while a butcher named Rett was a good
second, and he guessed the weights of
four other sheep within one pound. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
said that, one year, there died on the
Holkham estate a tenant who had won
no less than £800 in prizes at the "clippings."
Party politics were carefully
excluded from these meetings, and any
attempt to introduce a party spirit into
the speeches at the annual dinners was at
once silenced by Coke. As a politician
he was a prominent Whig, but as an agriculturist
he sank his politics and opened
his doors to men of merit irrespective of
their views. Thus he gave Sir John
Sinclair a magnificent goblet as a token of
his appreciation of Sinclair's "Code of
Agriculture," in spite of the fact that Sir
John was a strong supporter of the "vile
Tories and their viler head, Mr. Pitt."
Sir John was pleased beyond measure and
remarked, with a true Highland courtesy,
that hitherto the most priceless heirloom
in his castle had been the drinking cup of
Mary Queen of Scots, but henceforth he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
would look on the goblet of his Whig
friend as his greatest treasure.</p>

<p>The last of "Coke's Clippings" took
place in the year 1821. It was attended
by seven thousand people, and lasted three
whole days. There is something very
pleasing in the account of this pastoral
scene. A stately mansion in a splendid
park, with a group of village maidens
spinning flax, on a velvet lawn, in the
midst of a vast concourse of people drawn
from all parts of the earth. Punctually at
ten o'clock in the morning, so we read,
Miss Coke came on to the lawn, accompanied
by her father, and the Duke of
Sussex. Then after greetings taken and
greetings given, the vast crowd proceeded,
some riding, some driving, some walking,
to inspect the different farms on the
estate. The first day was given up to the
study of the inoculated pasture, prize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
cattle, new implements, sheep-shearing amid
farm crops. The second day was devoted
to fresh fields, farm schools and cottage
gardens. The third day was absorbed in
the inspection of the carcases of animals
that had been slaughtered, speech-making,
and the distribution of prizes. On that
day at 3 p.m., seven hundred guests sat
down to dinner, a mid-day meal, which,
with the speeches and prizes lasted for
seven hours! The historian of this period
has left us an account of the most popular
toasts at these annual banquets, such as
"A Fine Fleece and a Fat Carcase," "The
Plough and a Good Use of It," while the
tribute to Coke's efforts to enclose all
waste lands always brought down the
house, for it wittily ran: "The Enclosing
of all Waists," and Coke's own toast "Live
and Let Live," was invariably greeted with
tumultuous applause. The two annalists
who have left us unimpeachable accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of those memorable meetings are both
agreed that Coke himself was the central
figure. Dr. Rigby, in "Holkham and its
Agriculture" (1818) writes: "He is everywhere
and with everyone. He solicits
enquiry from everyone." At each halt in
the ride little knots of people collected
round him and listened with absorbed
interest to all he said, while for hours he
thus sustained the character of leader,
lecturer, and host. And the American
Ambassador of that day, His Excellency
Mr. Richard Rush, writes in "A Residence
at the Court of London," "No matter
what the subsequent advance of English
agriculture or its results, Mr. Coke will
ever take honourable rank among the
pioneers of the great work. Come what
will in the future, the Holkham sheep-shearings'
will live in English rural
annals. Long will tradition speak of
them as uniting improvements in agriculture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to an abundant, cordial, and
joyous hospitality."</p>

<p>When Coke started to farm in Norfolk
the value of rotation was unknown. Then,
it was customary to grow three white straw
crops in succession followed by broadcast
turnips. It was not to be wondered at
that soil which consisted mainly of drifting
sand and sharp, flinty gravel should soon
become worn out. Coke changed this
practice and grew only two white crops in
succession and then let the land lie in
pasture for the next two years. He
began to manure heavily; and used
rape-cake as a top dressing with marked
success. Moreover, he found that the
soil of almost the whole district was
composed of very light sand and underlaid
with a stratum of rich marl. Pits
were opened, the marl dug out, and
scattered over the surface of the land.
This not only promoted fertility, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
gave to the soil that solidity which is
so essential to the growth of wheat,
It was Coke's proud boast that he turned
West Norfolk from a rye-growing into
a wheat-growing district. But it took
him eleven years before he could get
wheat to grow on the poor, sandy soil of
his own estate. Nevertheless, before he
died, these so-called "rabbit and rye"
lands were yielding as much as thirty-two
bushels to the acre. His main idea was
to stock heavily; more for the sake of
manure than for the sake of meat. He
pinned his faith on the motto: "Muck is
the mother of money." And we are told
that he was accustomed to say to his
tenants, "If you will keep an extra yard
of bullocks, I will build you a yard and
sheds free of expense." He was a patient
man but he was once heard to remark:
"It is difficult to teach anything to adult
ignorance. I had to contend with prejudice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
an ignorant impatience of change,
and a rooted attachment to old methods."
He referred to the fact that the farmers
still persisted in the old system of sowing
cereals broadcast, or else laboriously made
holes with a dibbing-iron into which the
grain was dropped, while another man
followed with a rake and covered up the
holes. Thus he used the drill for sixteen
years before any of his neighbours could
be induced to adopt it; and even when
the farmers began at last to see the benefit
of this rapid manner of sowing, he estimated
that its spread was only a mile
each year. By-and-by, however, he
noticed that a quaint term for a good crop
of barley had come into use at Holkham.
His farmers spoke of "hat-barley" for the
reason that if a man throws his hat into a
crop of barley, the hat rests on the surface
if the crop is good, but falls to the ground
if the crop is bad. "All sir," said his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tenants at length, "is 'hat-barley' since
the drill came."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coke was never tired of experimenting
with every kind of crop. Cocksfoot
(orchard grass) was cultivated with great
success and numbers of sheep were fattened
on it. On land, once considered
worthless, he cut four hundred tons of
sainfoin from one hundred and four acres.
He early recognised the merits of swedes,
and was the first to grow them on a large
scale. He made a special study of birds
in relation to the eradication of grubs.
Finding a field of turnips infested with a
larva which caused black canker he turned
four hundred ducks into the field which
they cleared of this pest in five days.
Early in his career Coke discarded the
native sheep of Norfolk, with backs as
narrow as rabbits, in favour of the Southdowns,
and gradually became one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
largest sheep-breeders in England. Encouraged
by the Duke of Bedford, another
eminent agriculturist, he started a herd
of North Devons, and thereafter bred
them with much success. He also improved
the Suffolk breed of pigs by crossing
them with the Neapolitan, thereby
obtaining a superior quality of pork.
Afforestation was one of his special
hobbies. He fully realised the truth of
the old saying that a tree is growing
while its planter is sleeping. Every year
he planted fifty acres of timber, mostly
oak, Spanish chestnut, and beech, till he
had three thousand acres of bleak, wind-swept
country well covered. He permitted
the poor of the neighbourhood to
plant potatoes among his young trees for
two or three years; a practice which
kept his land clean and saved the expense
of hoeing. And in the year 1832 he
embarked in a ship built of oak from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the acorns which he himself had
planted.</p>

<p>He always maintained that the interests
of landlord and tenant were identical.
In order, therefore, to encourage his
tenants to exert themselves to the utmost,
he let out his farms on long leases of
twenty-one years at a moderate rental
and burdened with but few restrictions.
He soon saw, however, that in the case
of an indolent tenant a long lease would
mean the rapid deterioration of the
property. It happened at this time that
a certain farmer named Mr. Overman,
who had been foremost in furthering
the new agricultural schemes, applied for
a farm on the Holkham estate. Coke
allowed him, as an experiment, to draw
up the covenants of his own lease. Overman
straightway inserted a clause making
the improved course of cropping compulsory.
Coke was so pleased that he at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
once made this lease the model for all
his other tenants with a few slight modifications.
And so the land was fully
protected from any possible injury through
a long period of bad farming. By such
improved methods Coke is said to have
raised the annual rental of his estate from
£2,200 to £20,000; while the yearly fall
of timber and underwood averaged £2,700&mdash;a
sum which exceeded the whole of his
old rent roll. During his sixty-six years
at Holkham he spent over half a million
pounds sterling on improvements alone,
without taking into account the large
sums spent on his house, domain, and
home-farm buildings. Yet it is averred
that this vast outlay was all regained in
due course. At that period the Holkham
estate consisted of 4,300 acres in a ring
fence, with a park of 3,500 acres surrounded
by a ten-mile wall close to the
sea. In a volume entitled "Agricultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Writers" (1200-1800) by Donald
McDonald, the name of Coke does not
appear. And it would seem that all he
ever wrote were some papers for the
"Annals of Agriculture" (Arthur Young),
and a pamphlet on "An Address to the
Freeholders of Norfolk."</p>

<p>The biography of this remarkable man
has recently been written in two brightly
bound and lavishly illustrated volumes by
Mrs. A. M. W. Stirling, under the title of
"Coke and his Friends."<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His memory
well deserved the laborious and loving
tribute of his enthusiastic great grand-child.
But to be of any practical value
to the agriculturist, the book must be
greatly condensed. Out of thirty-five
chapters we can find only five which tell
of his services to the agricultural industry.
Out of a thousand odd pages we can find
only one hundred and sixteen which bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on the science and practice of farming.
Out of sixty-four carefully executed
illustrations we can only find four which
have anything whatsoever to do with
rural affairs. It may be affirmed that
Coke was much more than a mere agriculturist.
That is very true; but surely
his fame rests far more on his services to
rural progress than on his reputation as
a politician, a society leader, or a landlord.
We therefore hope that at no
distant date the same flowing pen which
has produced the bulkier volumes will
compile a handier life dealing altogether
with Coke's agricultural doings. Coke
died in 1842 at the age of eighty-eight,
and was buried in the family mausoleum
attached to the Tittleshall Church,
Norfolk.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Published by Mr. John Lane, London.</p></div>

<p>In a life drama so vivid and forceful
there are yet two vivid scenes we cannot
fail to recall. It was Coke who brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
forward the motion in the House of
Commons to recognise the independence
of the American Colonies. All night
long the House sat. At 8.30 a.m., the
end came. Amid breathless silence the
result was announced 177 Noes, 178
Ayes. It was Coke who announced to
the obstinate, discomfited King the result
of that great debate, whereby the disastrous
fratricidal war was forever ended
and the independence of the United
States acknowledged by the Parliament
of the Mother Country, after nine bitter
years, by a majority of one vote. The
Parish of Burnham lies next to the Parish
of Holkham. And the son of the rector
of the former village, a fragile, delicate
lad, used sometimes to join Mr. Coke's
hounds when they were out coursing.
But he was never asked to shoot, as only
once had he been known to hit a partridge.
One day this poor young man, returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
from a two years' cruise paid a visit to his
wealthy neighbour and stayed overnight.
The great-uncle of his host built the
mansion house of Holkham, and Thomas
William Coke spent all his life and a
large fortune in developing the family
estate. But the British people placed
Nelson, the frail and nervous guest, who
slept that night in the humble turret-room,
on the top of the Column in the
centre of Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p class="caption2">ARTHUR YOUNG: AUTHOR OF THE AGRICULTURAL TOUR</p>


<blockquote><p><i>"The magic of property turns sands into gold. Give
a man the secure possession of a bleak rock, and he will
turn it into a garden; give him a nine years' lease of a
garden, and he will convert it into a desert."</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur
Young.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Arthur Young, the greatest
of English agriculturists and the
poorest of practical farmers, was born at
Whitehall, London, in the year 1741.
He was the youngest son of the Reverend
Dr. Arthur Young, Prebendary of Canterbury
Cathedral, Rector of Bradfield, and
of Anne Lucretia, daughter of John de
Cousmaker, a Dutchman who accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
William of Orange to England.
From his father Arthur inherited good
looks and literary talent; and from his
mother the love of learning and brilliant
and pleasing speech.</p>

<p>Mrs. Young brought her clerical husband
a large dowry, much of which was
swallowed up in the vortex of his debts,
and later, on his death, in promoting the
agricultural schemes of her gifted but
unbusinesslike son. His home from the
first, and for the most part of his life, was
Bradfield Hall in the County of Suffolk&mdash;a
property which had been in the hands
of the Young family since the year 1672.
After a visit to Bradfield, reached from
Marks Tey on the Great Eastern Railway,
you do not wonder at Young's early
love of rural life. A broad, winding, elm-bordered
road, meadows knee-deep in
wild flowers and waving grasses, tangled
hedges of eglantine and honeysuckle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
rustling cornfields and silent woods&mdash;these,
all these, were the sweet pathways
to his home.</p>

<p>At the age of seven the lad was sent
to the Grammar School at Lavenham
in order to learn the Greek and Latin
languages, together with writing and
arithmetic. Owing to the indulgence of a
fond mother, his attendance at his classes
was irregular, and neither the centurions
of Cæsar nor the wooers of Penelope were
able to beguile him from his pony, his
pointer and his gun. But the cheapness
of his board and schooling would delight
the hearts of many parents in the Transvaal
and elsewhere in the year of grace
1912. Here is the bill:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Rev. Dr. Young to John Coulter (Master of
Lavenham School), Xmas, 1750 to Xmas, 1751. A
year's board, etc., £15. Sundries, £2 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Total,
£17 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>On leaving Lavenham, he was apprenticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
at the wish of his mother, to a
wine-merchant at Lynn. He deserted
his new work. He was fond of music
and the drama. He excelled in dancing,
but was always a diligent scholar.</p>

<p>His income, in those days, was not excessive,
being thirty pounds per annum:
but his foppery in dress deprived him
of the means wherewith to purchase his
beloved books. Accordingly, he wrote a
pamphlet entitled "The Theatre of the
Present War in North America," for
which he received ten pounds' worth of
books from the publisher. More balls
compelled him to compile more political
pamphlets in order to procure more books.
In the year 1759, at the age of eighteen,
he left the counting house at Lynn, as he
tells us in his own words, "without education,
pursuits, profession or employment."
That same year his father died much in
debt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>He next went to London and started at
his own expense a monthly magazine called
"The Universal Museum." It failed,
and he returned home. All his wealth
was now summed up in a freehold farm of
twenty acres. His mother owned eighty
acres at Bradfield. She persuaded him to
reside with her and to manage the farm.
He had no knowledge of agriculture, but
he accepted, and tells the story in his
own words: "Young, eager, and totally
ignorant of every necessary detail, it is
not surprising that I squandered large
sums under golden dreams of improvement."
At the age of twenty-four he
married Miss Martha Allen of Lynn.
One of his biographers says: "The
marriage brought him an enviable connection&mdash;troops
of friends, a passport
into brilliant circles, but no fireside
happiness. The lady was evidently of a
captious disposition, shrewish temper and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
narrow sympathies." Another biographer
writes: "A loving son, a devoted father,
Young was an indifferent husband."</p>

<p>Having failed to make a success of
his first farm, Young, nothing daunted,
undertook the cultivation of Sampford
Hall in Essex. This farm consisted of
300 acres of good arable land. But want
of practical knowledge, and want of
capital, drove him from it, and after a
five years' tenancy he paid a farmer £100
to take it off his hands. His successor
made a fortune on it. But during these five
years Young had made a large number
of experiments, the results of which he
afterwards published in two large volumes
under the title of "A Course of Experimental
Agriculture." Still unshaken in
his love of the soil, he sought another
farm, and the quest furnished materials
for his "Six Weeks' Tour through the
Southern Counties," a very popular work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
which ran through several editions. It
was at this time that on the advice of
his Suffolk bailiff he took a farm of
one hundred acres at North Mimms in
Hertfordshire. This property had a good
house, but that seems to have been all.
He was deceived by seeing it in a
specially good season. This speculation
proved worse than the last; but his
picturesque pen never failed: "I know
what epithet to give this soil. Sterility
falls short of the idea&mdash;a hungry, vitriolic
gravel. I occupied for nine years the
jaws of a wolf." The simple fact was
that whenever he put pen to paper
he was successful; whenever he turned
to practical farming he was a ruined
man.</p>

<p>He continued to write. His publisher
called for more tours. His receipts were
considerable, yet we find him recording:
"No carthorse ever laboured as I did at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
this period, spending like an idiot, always
in debt, in spite of what I earned with
the sweat of my brow, and almost my
heart's blood&mdash;the year's receipts £1,167."
About this time he wrote "Observations
on the Present State of the Waste Lands
of Great Britain," and was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society. Finding
that he could not make enough to live
on at farming, he accepted an appointment
as Parliamentary Reporter for the
"Morning Post" at five guineas a week&mdash;a
most incongruous job for a farmer
since it compelled him to be absent from
his home during six days of the week.
Yet he retained it for several years&mdash;walking
seventeen miles down to his farm
every Saturday evening and returning to
London every Monday morning.</p>

<p>In the year 1784 Young began the publication
of the "Annals of Agriculture"&mdash;a
monthly publication which ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
through forty-five volumes. These annals
covered the whole field of Agriculture in
the form of letters and essays from the
most eminent ruralists of the age. But
more than a fourth part of the whole
series came from the editor's ceaseless
pen. Even the King was persuaded to
contribute two letters under the <i>nom de
plume</i> of "Ralph Robinson," his Windsor
shepherd. Young related with much
pride that His Majesty said to him one
day on the terrace of Windsor: "Mr.
Young, I consider myself as more obliged
to you than to any other man in my
Dominions"; while the Queen observed
that they never travelled without a copy
of the "Annals" in the Royal carriage.
These volumes created quite a stir in
European circles, and from all parts of the
Continent there flocked scholars to study
at the feet of the Abelard of English
Agriculture. A year later Young's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mother died and Bradfield Hall and farm
became his property.</p>

<p>If Tull was the founder of dry-farming,
and Coke the father of the experimental
farm, Young was unquestionably the
author of the agricultural tour. From his
fertile pen flowed "The Southern," "The
Northern," and "The Eastern Tours,"
together with "The Tour in Ireland."
The first three tours were translated into
Russian by the express command of the
Empress Catherine, who at the same time
sent several young Russians to reside at
Bradfield for instruction in British agriculture.
It was his own opinion that the
most useful feature of the tours was the
practical information which they gave
on the important subject of the correct
courses of crops, on which all preceding
writers had been silent. His most famous
and most popular work was his "Travels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in France during the years 1787, 1788
and 1789."</p>

<p>Yet these remarkable journeys were
fore-shadowed twenty years before in a
little book he wrote entitled "The
Farmer's Letters to the People of England,"
in which he says: "The nobility
and men of large fortune travel, but no
farmers; unfortunately, those who have
this peculiar and distinguishing advantage,
the noble opportunity of benefiting themselves
and their country, seldom enquire
or even think about agriculture."</p>

<p>Then comes a sketch of a farmer's tour
with the routes laid down for the imaginary
traveller, being precisely those roads
he himself was to follow two decades
later.</p>

<p>In the year 1787 he received a pressing
invitation from a Polish friend in Paris to
join the Count de la Rochefoucauld in a
tour of the Pyrenees. "This was touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a string tremulous to vibrate," he writes:
"I had long wished for an opportunity to
examine France." His travels in France
were the sensation of the hour. No one
had done quite the same thing before. He
was an eye-witness of the moving scenes
which ushered in the French Revolution.
His name was in everybody's mouth. He
received invitations to Courts and salons.
All the learned societies enrolled him as
a member. His work was translated into
a score of languages. Princes, statesmen,
scientists, men of letters, simple farmers
and plain peasants paid a visit to Bradfield.
Among his correspondents we note the
names of Washington, Pitt. Burke,
Wilberforce, Lafayette, Priestly and
Jeremy Bentham. So it happened that
when the affluent Coke of Norfolk was
holding a Continental sheep-shearing salon
at Holkham, his indigent neighbour, fifty
miles to the south, was holding a European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
levee to discuss the fundamental principles
of rural economy.</p>

<p>Four years later Young's heart was
broken by the death of his favourite
daughter, "Bobbin" at the early age of
fourteen. He developed religious melancholia,
shunned society, left his Journal
blank and brooded over sermons. His
sight began to fail. He was operated on
for cataract. Wilberforce, warned to be
careful, went, a week later, to see him in
the darkened room. In his sweet and
elegant voice the Great Emancipator
spoke feelingly of the death of a mutual
friend. Young burst into tears and
became for ever blind. The remainder
of his life was spent in preaching the
Gospel to the peasantry and in works of
charity. He died in the eightieth year of
his age in Sackville Street, London, and
was buried at Bradfield, April, 1820.</p>

<p>It is impossible in this brief article to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
do more than mention the writings of
Young. These we must reserve for a
subsequent paper. Our library is far from
complete, yet we possess sixty-six volumes
of his sparkling prose, which, placed one
upon another, attain to a height of nine
feet&mdash;a monument of amazing industry.
True, he was not exempt from those petty
jealousies which so often mar the character
of eminent men. He tried to snatch some
credit for the Board of Agriculture from
Sir John Sinclair, and he scoffed at the
idea that Jethro Tull had invented the
corn-drill. He met and conversed with
the greatest savants of the age, yet his
mind never burst the old wine bottles
which he served out in the Suffolk store.
And so he arrogantly says that Canada
and Nova Scotia are not worth colonising.
"If they continue poor, they will be no
markets. If rich they will revolt; and
that perhaps is the best thing they can do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for our interest." ... "The loss of India
must come. It ought to come." Yet
with all his foolish fancies what a splendid
life! For he was the Prophet of the
New Agriculture in the Valley of Dry
Bones. And England may well write the
epitaph of her illustrious son in the words
of Ezekiel: "This land that was desolate
is become like the Garden of Eden."</p>

<p class="caption2">JOHN SINCLAIR: FOUNDER OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE</p>


<p>One of the earliest recollections of
the writer's childhood as he fished
for trout in the Swiney Burn in the far
North of Scotland, was the tale of a
certain wonderful man that was wont
to tie little shoes on the feet of his sheep
in order to keep them warm while walking
through the snow. But many a trout
had to be caught, and many a ripple of
the shining river had to pass beneath the
Thurso Bridge ere he learned the name of
the strange person who struck his childish
fancy as he looked up from his quivering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
line into the wistful eyes of a Cheviot
ewe on the lonely, wine-red, moor.</p>

<p>Sir John Sinclair, the founder of the
British Board of Agriculture, was born in
Thurso Castle in the county of Caithness,
on May 10th, 1754. His father, George
Sinclair, the Laird of Ulbster, was a
descendant of the Earls of Caithness and
Orkney; while his mother, Lady Janet
Sutherland of Dunrobin, was the sister
of the sixteenth Earl of that name. As a
child he was carefully and wisely trained
by his parents. From his father, a man
of literary tastes and deeply religious
character, he inherited a love of books;
and from his gentle mother, he learned
the lesson that life is not an empty
dream; and her lad was soon to be
known as "the most indefatigable man
in Europe."</p>

<p>John was educated at the Royal School
of Edinburgh, and at the University of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the same city which he entered at the
early age of thirteen. He also studied
at Glasgow, and at Trinity College,
Oxford. He was called to the Bar in
1782. His father died suddenly when
John was sixteen, and he found himself
heir to Estates comprising some 100,000
acres, mainly bleak and barren moor.
He at once began to improve his
property.</p>

<p>Scottish agriculture was then in a most
backward state. The fields were unenclosed,
the lands were undrained. The
small farmers of Caithness were so poor
that they could hardly afford to keep a
horse, or even a Shetland pony. The
burdens were chiefly borne by women.
Indeed, according to Smiles, if a cottar
lost a horse, it was not unusual for him
to marry a wife as the cheapest substitute.</p>

<p>The country was without roads or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
bridges. Drovers taking their cattle to
the South had to swim rivers alongside
their beasts. The chief track leading into
the country lay along the high shelf of a
mountain called Ben Cheilt; the path
being several hundred feet above the
storm-tossed sea, which thundered on
the rocks below.</p>

<p>Imagine the loud laughter of the elders
of this community when they heard a
rumour that young Sinclair proposed to
build in a single day a road over this
hitherto impassable hill. But John surveyed
the road himself, and ordered up
the Statute labour. At that time the
law decreed that all capable inhabitants
of the agricultural class should work on
the roads for six days in every year.
And so, early one summer morning, he
assembled the neighbouring farmers and
their servants&mdash;a total of 1,260. Each
party, on arrival, was assigned a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
piece of the path where they found tools
and provisions awaiting them. At sunset
of the same evening the youth drove his
carriage and pair over six miles of mountain
road which the night before had been
a dangerous sheep-track. Tidings of this
exploit by a stripling of eighteen spread
far and wide, and spurred the sleeping
spirit of the North.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-six, John Sinclair
was elected member of Parliament for
the county of Caithness, and remained in
the House of Commons for upwards of
thirty years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The great monument to Sinclair's indefatigable
industry is his "Statistical
Account of Scotland" in twenty-one
volumes, one of the most valuable works
on agriculture ever published in any
country. It took seven years and seven
months of incessant labour to complete.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
It was then that the word "statistics"
and "statistical" were first introduced
into the English language by Sinclair.
He made use of the clergy to obtain
the information he desired. He sent a
circular letter to each parish minister
in Scotland with 160 questions under
four heads: (1) Geography and Natural
History. (2) Population. (3) Production.
(4) Miscellaneous subjects.</p>

<p>In the collection of data many difficulties
occurred. Some of the clergy scorned
the idea that one man could collect and
collate all this information: others were
lazy both in mind and body: and some
were old and infirm. Several parishes
were vacant, some too huge to fully cover,
many were without roads, and not a few
separated by tempestuous arms of the sea.
To overcome these obstacles he enlisted
the aid of the leaders of the Church of
Scotland, of which he was a member, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the great landowners, and as a last resort
he employed statistical missionaries to
supply the missing information. He
generously assigned all the profits of this
publication to the Scottish Fund for the
benefit of the sons of the clergy, and obtained
for that Society a Royal grant of
£2,000. Among the direct results of this
work was the raising of the stipends of
ministers and schoolmasters&mdash;surely a convincing
reply to his critics in the manses&mdash;the
abolition of what was then called thirlage
or the compulsory grinding of corn at
a particular mill. Charles Abbot, afterwards
Lord Colchester, the originator of
the census of England, wrote to Sinclair:
"Your success suggested to me the idea,"
and the various bureaux of statistics in the
United States and other countries can be
directly traced to the influence of his
treatise.</p>

<p>In the year 1788 Sinclair founded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Wool Society. For some time he had
been wondering why Shetland wool was so
extremely fine. Meeting at the General
Assembly in Edinburgh a Shetland minister,
he put the question to him and
obtained much valuable information which
he at once laid before the Highland
Society. This led him to form the British
Wool Society. It was inaugurated by a
grand sheep-shearing festival at Newhall's
Inn, Queensferry, near Edinburgh, in the
year 1791. To Sinclair, therefore, belongs
the credit of initiating the sheep-shearing
contests which a few years later developed
into Coke's famous "clippings," and which
were the precursors of our present agricultural
shows. The first agricultural show
was held by the Highland and Agricultural
Society at Edinburgh in 1822. It was the
Long Hill sheep of the East Border that
Sinclair re-christened by the now famous
name of Cheviot. These sheep soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
became naturalised all over the north of
Scotland, and in a short time the rent of
sheep firms rose to fabulous prices. Pastures
of little value under coarse-woolled
sheep yielded large returns. As an
illustration of the practical value of his
improvements it may be mentioned that
Sinclair's estate of Langwell, which he had
bought for £8,000, he afterwards sold for
£40,000: while the estate of Reay in
Sutherlandshire was purchased at £300,000.
The name Cheviot comes from the range
of rounded or cone-shaped hills growing a
superior pasture on the Scottish and
English border.</p>

<p>In the opening lines of this article I
spoke of a childish tale about sheep-shearing.
That this legend is not mere
fiction may be seen in the following letter
of Arthur Young (see Autobiography of
Arthur Young, page 159): "From Sir J.
Sinclair on clothing for sheep which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sent and desired me to buy. I did so, and
the rest of the flock took them, I suppose,
for beasts of prey, and fled in all directions,
till the clothed sheep, jumping hedges and
ditches, soon derobed themselves."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his third lecture in the "Crown of
Wild Olives," Ruskin points out that all
the pure and noble arts of peace are
founded on war. It is worth while, therefore,
to note that the British Board of
Agriculture was established when Britain
was engaged in the supreme struggle with
France, which terminated on the field of
Waterloo, that the National Department
of Agriculture in the United States was
inaugurated in the midst of the Civil War,
and that the Transvaal Department of
Agriculture was commenced ere peace
was signed at Vereeniging. In the year
1793 Sinclair's services in restoring commercial
confidence during the crisis which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
occurred at the outbreak of the French
War were recognised by Pitt, who sent
for him to come to Downing Street,
thanked him on behalf of the Government,
and asked him if there was anything that
he desired. Sinclair replied that he sought
no favours for himself, but the most
gratifying of all would be the establishment
by Parliament of a great National
Corporation to be called "The Board of
Agriculture." In due course the Board
was successfully established with the King
as Patron, Sinclair as President, and
Arthur Young as Secretary. The annual
Parliamentary grant was £3,000.</p>

<p>In this brief review we have no space
to follow the fortune of the Board to the
date of the retirement of its inspiring
founder, down to the time when it returned
£42,000 to the Treasury&mdash;not knowing
how to spend it&mdash;till it finally faded
away in the year 1822. Yet the Board accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
much imperishable work. It
carried out agricultural surveys, published
several volumes of "communications,"
promoted prize essays on rural topics, encouraged
Elkington, the father of drainage,
Macadam the road-maker, and Meikle,
the inventor of the threshing machine, and
arranged lectures by Sir Humphry Davy
on agricultural chemistry, and by Young
on tillage.</p>

<p>The north of Scotland at that period
owed much to Sinclair. In 1782 he saved
the inhabitants from a serious famine
by obtaining a Parliamentary grant of
£15,000. In the same year, along with
some other patriots, he secured the repeal
of the law which for thirty-seven years&mdash;since
the Rebellion of 1745&mdash;had forbidden
the use of the kilt.</p>

<p>Sinclair was an enthusiastic tree-planter
in a country which was once wittily
described by an American visitor as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"Great Clearing." He rebuilt Thurso,
and founded the herring fisheries at
Wick. To ensure the success of this
industry he imported Dutch fishermen to
teach the Caithnessmen the art of catching
and curing herrings. He introduced
improved methods of tillage, a regular
rotation of crops, and the cultivation of
turnips, clover, and rye-grass. One of
his many schemes was a General Enclosure
Bill, his toast at agricultural gatherings
being: "May a Common become an
Uncommon Spectacle in Caithness."</p>

<p>In 1786 his attachment to William Pitt
was rewarded with a baronetcy. Sir
John's domestic life was singularly happy.
On referring to the old book already
mentioned, we read: "He has been twice
married to two of the most beautiful
women in the island. His first lady, a
Miss Maitland, died prematurely in the
bloom of youth. His present lady is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
daughter of the late Lord Macdonald,
and by her he has a son, George, and
other children."</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that Sir John
loved the limelight, possessed an unbounded
self-conceit, lacked the saving
sense of humour, and over-estimated his
own achievements. But these vanities
were but the fitful smoke in the blue
flame of a burning energy. What a
lesson in industry for the youth of South
Africa. Fifty years of ceaseless toil,
author of thirty-nine volumes and 367
pamphlets. This Scottish agriculturist
died in 1835 at the ripe age of eighty-one,
and is buried according to an ancient
family rite, in Holyrood Chapel at Edinburgh&mdash;the
friend and confidant of three
English kings.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be expected that those
people who devoutly chant in a
million churches the fourth sentence of
the Lord's Prayer should think with
gratitude of any other person than the
Divine Giver of all Good. Yet it is
strange to reflect that although every
schoolboy knows something of the life of
our least Poet Laureate, not one in ten
thousand could tell you the career of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
man who responded in a truly miraculous
manner to the heartfelt, world-voiced
matin of both rich and poor, "Give us
this day our daily bread."</p>

<p>Cyrus H. McCormick, the inventor of
the reaping machine, was born in the
eventful year 1809. It was the birth
year of Darwin and Tennyson, of Mendelssohn,
Gladstone, and Lincoln. He was
born on Walnut Grove Farm, amidst the
mountains of Virginia, one hundred miles
from the sea. He came of that virile
stock that has proved to be the main
strength of the Republic, that gave
Washington thirty-nine of his generals,
three out of four members of his Cabinet,
and three out of the five judges of the
Supreme Court&mdash;the Scots who migrated
to Ulster, and thence to the United
States. Robert McCormick, the father
of Cyrus, was a fairly large farmer, and
an inventor of no mean ability. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
little log workshop is still shown to the
enquiring tourist where father and son
moulded and mended machinery on many
a rainy day. Indeed, we are told that
the McCormick homestead was more like
a small factory than a farmer's home, so
full was it of rural industries&mdash;spinning
and weaving, soap and shoes, butter-making
and bacon-curing. And it is
more than likely that the ceaseless
activity of his wise and Celtic mother
taught Cyrus the value of each moment
of time.</p>

<p>Ever since he was a child of seven it
was his father's ambition to invent a
reaper. He made one, and tried it in the
harvest of 1816, but it proved a failure.
It was a fantastic machine, pushed from
behind by two horses. It was highly
ingenious, but it would not cut the corn,
and was hauled off the field to become
one of the jokes of the countryside. Hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
by the jests of his neighbours, he locked
the door of his workshop and toiled
away at night. Early in the summer of
1831 he had so improved his reaper that
he gave it another trial. Again it failed.
True, the machine cut the corn fairly well,
but it flung it on the ground in a tangled
heap. Satisfied that there was something
radically wrong, Robert McCormick gave
up the reaper after having worked at it
for over fifteen years.</p>

<p>At this point Cyrus took up the task
which his father had reluctantly abandoned.
He showed his genius from the
very start by adopting a new principle of
operation. First of all, he invented the
divider to separate the corn to be cut from
the corn left standing. Next came the
reciprocating blade, and the fingers,
the revolving reel, platform, and side
draught, and, lastly, the big driving
wheel. One day late in the month of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
July, in the summer of 1831, Cyrus put a
horse between the shafts of his reaper.
With no spectators save his father and
mother, his brothers and sisters, he drove
down to a patch of yellow grain. To that
little family circle it must have been a
moment of intense excitement. Click,
click, click&mdash;the white blade shot to and
fro. What a shout of joy! The wheat
is cut and falls upon the platform in a
golden, shimmering swathe!</p>

<p>Thus at the early age of twenty-two
Cyrus had invented the first practical
reaper that the world had seen. And now
began his nine years' struggle with adversity,
from which he emerged in triumph
to become the greatest manufacturer of
harvesting machines that America has
produced. In order to obtain funds with
which to manufacture reapers he started
to farm. But he soon found that it was
impossible to raise sufficient capital by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
this means. Near by was a large deposit
of iron ore, and he forthwith resolved to
build a furnace and make iron. He persuaded
his father and the school teacher
to become his partners. For several years
the furnace did fairly well, when, suddenly,
the price of iron fell. The McCormicks
were bankrupt. Cyrus gave up the farm,
and stuck grimly to his reaper. One day
the village constable rode up to the farm
door with a summons for a debt of nine-teen
dollars, but he was so impressed with
the industry of the McCormicks that he
had not the heart to serve the notice. It
was the darkest hour before the dawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same year (1840) a stranger rode
in from the north and drew rein in front
of the little log workshop. He was a
rough looking man with the homely name
of Abraham Smith, but to Cyrus he came
as an angel of light. He had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
with fifty dollars in his pocket to buy a
reaper&mdash;the first that was ever sold. A
short time later two other farmers came
on the same errand, and that summer
three reaping machines were working in
the wheat-fields of America. In 1842
McCormick sold seven machines, and in
1844 fifty. The home farm had now
become a busy factory.</p>

<p>Three years later a friend said to him
"Cyrus, why don't you go West with your
reaper, where the land is level and labour
cheap?"</p>

<p>It was the call of the West.</p>

<p>He travelled over the boundless prairies,
and was quick to see that this great land-ocean
was the natural home of the reaper.
Straightway he transferred his factory to
Chicago&mdash;then, in 1847, a forlorn little
town of less than 10,000 souls. His
business flourished. In the great fire of
1871 his factory, which was then turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
out 10,000 harvesters a year, was totally
destroyed. At the word of his wife he
rebuilt it anew with amazing rapidity.
And so we find that the tiny workshop in
the backwoods of Virginia has become the
McCormick City in the heart of Chicago.
In the sixty-five years of its life this
manufactory has produced over 6,000,000
harvesting machines, and is now pouring
them out at the rate of over 7,000 per
week. The McCormick Company is now
known as the International Harvester
Company, and his eldest son, Cyrus H.
McCormick, is the President. The annual
output is 75,000,000 dollars. It was the
reaper that enabled the United States,
during the four years of the civil war, not
only to feed the armies in the field, but
at the same time to export to foreign
countries 200,000,000 bushels of wheat.
And well might the savants of the French
Academy of Science say, when electing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Cyrus McCormick a member, that "he
had done more for the cause of agriculture
than any other living man."</p>

<p>And now we must trace the evolution
of the reaper from its origin on the
Walnut Grove Farm to the marvellous
machine of to-day. For about thirty
years it remained practically unaltered in
design, save that seats had been added
for the raker and the driver. It did no
more than cut the grain and leave it in
loose bundles on the ground. It had
abolished the sickler and cradler, but
there still remained the raker and binder.
Might it not be possible to do away with
them also, and leave only the driver?
Such was the fascinating problem which
now confronted the inventor.</p>

<p>In the year 1852 a bedridden cripple
called Jearum Atkins bought a McCormick
reaper, and had it placed outside his
window. To while away the weary hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
he actually devised an attachment with
two revolving iron arms, which automatically
raked off the cut grain from the platform
to the ground. It was a grotesque
contrivance, and was nicknamed by the
farmers the "iron man." Nevertheless,
this invention stimulated the manufacture
of self-rake reapers, and soon the
American farmer would buy no other
kind. Thus part of the problem had
been solved. The raker was abolished.
But there still remained the harder task
of supplanting the binder&mdash;the man or
the woman who gathered up the bundles
of cut corn and bound them tightly
together with a wisp of straw into the
sheaf.</p>

<p>And now another figure appears upon
this ever-moving stage, a young man by
the name of Charles B. Withington.
Born at Akron, Ohio, a year before
McCormick invented his reaper, this delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
youth was trained by his father to
be a watchmaker. At the age of fifteen,
in order to earn pocket-money, he went
into the harvest field to bind corn. He
was not robust, and the hard, stooping
labour under a hot sun would sometimes
bring the blood to his head in a hemorrhage.
There were times after the day's
work was done when he was too weary to
walk home, and he would throw himself
on the stubble to rest. At eighteen he
journeyed to the goldfields of California,
drifted to Australia, and in the year
1855 arrived back in Wisconsin with
3,000 dollars in his belt. All this money
he began to fritter away in trying to
invent a self-rake reaper. Suddenly,
inspired by the articles of a rural editor,
who maintained that the binding of corn
should be done by a machine, Withington
dropped his self-rake and went straight to
work to make a self-binder. He completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
his first machine in 1872, but met
with much discouragement until, two
years later, he came across McCormick.</p>

<p>Their dramatic meeting is best told by
Mr. Herbert M. Casson in his interesting
volume, entitled "Cyrus Hall McCormick:
His Life and Work."</p>

<blockquote><p>"One evening in 1874 a tall man; with a box
under his arm, walked diffidently up the steps of the
McCormick home in Chicago, and rang the bell.
He asked to see Mr. McCormick, and was shown
into the parlour, where he found Mr. McCormick,
sitting, as usual, in a large and comfortable chair.</p>

<p>"'My name is Withington,' said the stranger; I
live in Janesville, Wisconsin. I have here a model
of a machine that will automatically bind grain.'</p>

<p>"Now, it so happened that McCormick had been
kept awake nearly the whole of the previous night
by a stubborn business problem. He could scarcely
hold his eyelids apart. And when Withington was
in the midst of his explanation, with the intentness
of a born inventor, Mr. McCormick fell fast asleep.
At such a reception to his cherished machine
Withington lost heart. He was a gentle, sensitive
man easily rebuffed, and so, when McCormick aroused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from his nap, Withington had departed, and was
on his way back to Wisconsin. For a few seconds
McCormick was uncertain as to whether his visitor
had been a reality or a dream. Then he awoke with
a start into instant action. A great opportunity had
come to him, and he had let it slip. He was at this
time making self-rake reapers and Marsh harvesters;
but what he wanted&mdash;what every reaper manufacturer
wanted in 1871&mdash;was a self-binder. He at
once called one of his trusted workmen.</p>

<p>"'I want you to go to Janesville,' he said. Find
a man named Withington and bring him to me by
the first train that comes back to Chicago.'</p>

<p>"The next day Withington was brought back, and
treated with the utmost courtesy. McCormick studied
his invention, and found it to be a most remarkable
mechanism. Two steel arms caught each bundle of
grain, whirled a wire tightly around it, fastened the
two ends together with a twist, cut it loose, and
tossed it to the ground. This self-binder was
perfect in all its details&mdash;as neat and effective a
machine as could be imagined. McCormick was
delighted. At last, here was a machine that would
abolish the binding of grain by hand."</p></blockquote>

<p>For six years all went well with the
McCormick and Withington self-binder.
This wonderful wire-twisting machine was
working everywhere with clockwork precision,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and was believed to be the best
that human ingenuity could devise. All
at once the manufacturing world was
startled with the news that William
Deering had made and sold three thousand
twine self-binders. Deering, by this dramatic
move became in a flash McCormick's
most powerful competitor. He
was not a farmer's son, like the latter,
being bred in the city and trained in a
factory. He had been a successful merchant
at Maine, then left it to enter the
harvester trade. He staked his whole
fortune on making twine binders. He
won, and McCormick was forced to
follow in his wake. The evolution of the
reaper into the twine self-binder was an
epoch-making event in the agricultural
world. It enormously increased the sales.
In 1880, 60,000 reapers were sold; five
years later the figures had risen to 250,000.
Since then, with the exception of the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
knot-tying device, there has been no real
change in the reaper. It remains the
grandest of all agricultural machines, and
one of the most astonishing mechanisms
ever devised by the brain of man.</p>

<p>McCormick died in 1884. In the span
of his own life the reaper was born and
brought to perfection. He created it in
a remote Virginian village, and he lived
to see his catalogue printed in twenty
languages, and to know that so long as
the human race continues to eat bread
the sun will never set on the Empire of
his reaper, for somewhere, in every month
in all the year, you will find the corn
white unto the harvest.</p>

page 36 states "Coke died in 1842 at the age of eighty-eight"; and
Wikipedia reports Coke was born on 6 May 1754 and died 30 June 1842
(aged 88). So, the year of Coke's birth on page 17 should probably be
1754. Wikipedia shows that a gravestone has been placed on Mr. Tull's
